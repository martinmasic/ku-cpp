* ku-cpp

** Description
My attempt at a general sudoku program. Probably not going to finish, since it's C++.

** Roadmap
- [X] generate full board
- [X] generate valid puzzle from full board
- [ ] option to specify difficulty of generated puzzle
- [ ] other capabilities, yet to be determined
- [ ] general CLI argument parsing
- [ ] alternative build systems: make/ninja, cmake/autotools, zig
- [ ] terminal application with a menu and submenus, solve history etc.
